Per her ethnicity, she was a white woman of mixed ethnicity. Her father is of Cajun, Sicilian, and English descent while her mother is of English, Scottish, and Italian ancestry. Regardless of this mix, she was an American nationality.</p><p>Her father, Tony, was working as an oil agent at the time he had Wendy and was raising her alongside her three siblings; two sisters named Lacey Chabert, and Chrissy Chabert, and a brother named T.J Chabert.</p><p>Growing up, the Chabert siblings were raised in Purvis, Lamar County, Mississippi, USA, where they attended a local school for their elementary education. For her high school studies, Wendy was enrolled in New York’s Junior High School of the Performing Arts. However, beyond this point, it is not known if she furthered her education to the tertiary level.</p><h2><strong>Meet Wendy Chabert’ Siblings</strong></h2><p>Of the four children Tony Chabert and Julie Johnson had, the late Wendy Chabert and her surviving sister, Lacey Charbet, seems to be the more popular ones. Chrissy and T.J Chabert are a lot laid back and seem not interested or bothered by living a celebrity lifestyle. However, that does not mean that they aren’t successful in their own rights.</p><h3><strong>Chrissy Chabert is a Chef and Restauranter&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Born on 20th November 1982, 41-year-old Chrissy Chabert was 7 years younger than Wendy. She attended the same high school as Wendy and when she completed her high school studies, she enrolled in a bachelor’s degree program at the University of Southern Mississippi.</p><p>Following her graduation, she worked several jobs before deciding to set up her own business. This resulted in the establishment of the restaurant called Stone House in 2008 in Purvis, Mississippi. On their menu at the time were specially and tastefully made Cajun, paninis, burgers, and salads. However, recently, the restaurant is no more as Chrissy has relocated to Italy with her family.</p><p>Chrissy is also a married woman.

Similarly, Ethan is already a married man whose wife is named Kelly, a photographer.</p><h3><strong>Lacey Chabert is a Famous Actress</strong></h3><p>Lacey Chabert was born on the 30th of September 1982. She was born seven years after her late sister, Wendy. And like the rest of her siblings, she attended a local elementary school and New York’s Junior High School of the Performing Arts.</p><p>She began her acting career officially with a voice role in the film titled Journey Beneath the Sea as the character of Merla. This was in the year 1997. From then to the present time, Lacey has acted in a myriad of films and television series and gained fame for herself and her family’s name. She is also a married woman.

He is also the youngest child amongst the Chabert siblings. Not many details have been revealed about him but from what we know, he was diagnosed with Leukemia. His sister, Lacy, took to social media in March 2016 to solicit prayers from her fans over her brother. And miraculously, his health improved as Lacey also disclosed on social media in August 2016.</p><h2><strong>What Did Wendy Chabert do for a Living?</strong></h2><p>While she lived, Wendy Chabert actively pursued a modeling career and was quite remarkably famous on social media where she regularly shared fitness goals and how to achieve them. By doing this, she not only had tons of followers on social media but also became a social media influencer.</p><h3><strong>Wendy Chabert was Waiting for a Divorce Before She Died</strong></h3><p>Before she died, Wendy Chabert was a married woman and in fact a mother of two. She got married to a man named Shane Riggio and they lived happily for some time during which Wendy had her two kids. However, they began having problems in which made Wendy decide to opt out of the marriage.</p><p>She approached the court for a divorce sometime in August 2019. However, she did not live long enough to get the freedom she sought from this marriage. Their divorce case was still in court when she died on the 24th of November 2021.</p><h2><strong>Wendy Chabert Died at the Age of 46</strong></h2><p>Wendy Chabert died on the 24th of November 2021 at the age of 46. Before her death, she was living in Texas. Details about her death have not been officially released by their family and perhaps never will. However, it is rumored that she died in a fatal car accident.</p><p>Admittedly, Wendy’s death caused a lot of pain to her family members. About a month after her death, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Lacey took to social media</a> and wrote that their hearts were shattered into a million pieces because of her passing and perhaps may never heal. She, however, expressed hope that they will cling to the promises of Jesus that they will be together again in eternity. She also encouraged their fans to remember Wendy’s two boys in their prayers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunDDxKebsmWTna6jsdGtZLCgkal6pbXDZqqhnV2lrrS%2FjJqumrFdm7%2BwuY4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./wild-squirrel-nut-butter-shark-tank-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wild Squirrel Nut Butter Shark Tank Net Worth 2024">&larr;
