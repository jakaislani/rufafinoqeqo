She got her first big break in 2003 as one of the five winners of the reality show American Juniors, a children's spinoff of American Idol. Concentrating on acting, she joined the cast of the CW’s Privileged in 2008, and went on to win the role of Aria Montgomery on Pretty Little Liars, which ran from 2010-17. Hale then starred on the short-lived Life Sentence, before being tapped for the title role of the Riverdale spinoff Katy Keene.﻿</p><h2 id=quick-facts data-node-id=3 class="body-h2 css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="body-tip css-1feebo7 emevuu60">FULL NAME:﻿ Karen Lucille Hale<br>BORN: ﻿June 14, 1989<br>BIRTHPLACE: Memphis, Tennessee<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Gemini﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><h2 id=movies data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Movies</h2><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h3 css-1qkukwl emevuu60">The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 and Truth or Dare</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2008, Hale made her big screen debut in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2, playing Effie, the younger sister of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/alexis-bledel data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alexis Bledel" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Alexis Bledel</a>’s character, Lena Kaligaris. In 2011, she had a cameo in Scream 4. In 2018, she returned to the horror genre with Truth or Dare, about a group of friends who head to Mexico for one last round of partying before college graduation. Hale’s character, Olivia, befriends a guy who invites the group to play the titular — and seemingly harmless — game. But then people start dying.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h3 css-1qkukwl emevuu60">Dude, The Unicorn, and Fantasy Island</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dude, which was released on Netflix in April 2018, is a coming-of-age comedy focused on four high school girlfriends, played by Hale, Kathryn Prescott, Alexandra Shipp and Awkwafina. The death of a common friend looms over the otherwise raunchy stoner comedy about misbehaving teenage girls. Hale also appeared in another 2018 comedy, The Unicorn, as a free spirit who joins a couple looking to spice up their relationship, before returning to the big screen in February 2020 with Blumhouse's Fantasy Island, a horror reboot of the classic TV series.</p><h2 id=tv-shows data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-1a93ikt emevuu60">TV Shows</h2><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h3 css-1qkukwl emevuu60">Pretty Little Liars</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Based on a series of books by Sara Shepard of the same name, Pretty Little Liars was an ensemble teen mystery television series that debuted on ABC Family (now Freeform) in 2010 and aired for seven seasons. The show focused on a group of high school students and best friends living in Rosewood, Pennsylvania, whose de facto leader disappeared one night during a sleepover. Hale, who won several awards for her portrayal of Aria Montgomery, including a Teen Choice Award for four different years, is the one who came up with the iconic "shhh" gesture in the show’s intro. "[My] shushing the camera was actually a spur-of-the-moment idea that happened to make the final cut," she told Cosmopolitan.com.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h3 css-1qkukwl emevuu60">Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve’</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2015, Hale joined the production of the annual <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/dick-clark data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dick Clark" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Dick Clark</a>'s New Year's Rockin' Eve show as a correspondent for the New Orleans branch of festivities.

"The creators [Erin Cardillo and Richard Keith] hung out with me a few times to get a sense of how I talk and act, and they kind of created the character around me," she told Elle in 2018. "It's a lot more work, but I like having the weight of the world on my shoulders." Despite her personal investment in the character, Hale's time as Stella Abbott was brief, as Life Sentence failed to earn a second season on the air.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h3 css-1qkukwl emevuu60">Katy Keene</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Following the success of the Archie comics-based Riverdale in 2017, Hale was tapped to star in the CW spinoff Katy Keene as its leading fashionista. Despite the shared DNA between the two shows, Katy Keene is described as being "very different from Riverdale" by creator Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, with the newer production taking place five years in the future and featuring musical numbers. Katy Keene debuted in February 2020.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h3 css-1qkukwl emevuu60">Other TV Roles</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hale has appeared on numerous popular television shows as a guest star, including Wizards of Waverly Place, How I Met Your Mother and CSI: Miami. Her first recurring role came in 2007, when she was cast in NBC's short-lived re-imagining of the Bionic Woman as Becca Sommers, the younger sister of title character Jaime Sommers. The following year, she won the lead role of Rose Baker in the CW’s comedy-drama Privileged, but it was also cancelled after one season.</p><h2 id=personal-life data-node-id=23 class="body-h2 css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hale broke up with her musician boyfriend Anthony Kalabretta in May 2017. She is currently dating Riley Smith, her former Life Sentence co-star.</p><h2 id=lucy-hales-net-worth data-node-id=25 class="body-h2 css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Lucy Hale’s Net Worth</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As of 2019, Hale reportedly had a net worth of $6 million.</p><h2 id=early-years-and-music data-node-id=27 class="body-h2 css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Early Years and Music</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Born on June 14, 1989, in Memphis, Tennessee, as Karen Lucille Hale, she is the youngest of Julia Knight’s and John Preston Hale’s three children. Hale always aspired to be a singer, and her dream was realized in 2003 when she competed on American Juniors, an American Idol spinoff that forged a group from five of its young contestants. Hale successfully won her place in the band with her performance of Blondie's 1980 hit "Call Me."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In June 2012, Hale signed a record deal with Hollywood Records. Her debut album, Road Between, came out in 2014 and featured the singles "You Sound Good to Me," and "Lie a Little Better." She has often stated that music is her first love and, though her acting work is keeping her busy, she's always working on her side career.</p>Fact Check: ﻿We strive for accuracy and fairness.
