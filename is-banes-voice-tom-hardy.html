He based the unique voice on a boxer named Bartley Gorman.</span></span><h2>Who did Bane's voice?</h2>Tom Hardy as Bane. Credit: Warner Bros. Speaking to Wired alongside Andy Serkis - the Venom 2 director - Hardy addressed the point whilst answering some of the world's most searched questions about him.<h2>How did Tom Hardy change his voice for Bane?</h2>Of course Bane is masked in The Dark Knight Rises which changes the sound of his voice, making it more muffled. And as Hardy explained in his Wired interview, he and Dark Knight Rises director Nolan did “play around” with the voice, making it more fluid.<h2>Why did they give Bane that voice?</h2>While the accent received mixed reviews from fans and critics, there was actually quite a bit of thought put into its creation. Hardy explained: That was actually a really cool choice that Chris [Nolan] made. Bane quintessentially is Latinx in origin and I'm not.<h2>Does Tom Hardy speak in Dark Knight Rises?</h2>Tom Hardy has admitted he knew people may laugh at his Bane voice in The Dark Knight Rises. The actor played the masked DC villain in the 2012 conclusion to Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy – though his voice has been the subject of some mockery among fans.<h2>Tom Hardy Explains the Origins of His Bane Voice!</h2><p></p><h2>How much weight did Tom Hardy gain for Bane?</h2>To meet the demands of the role, Hardy — chameleonic as ever — gained two stone (13kg/30lbs) in weight, bringing him to a hefty 90 kilos. "Compared to Christian Bale I've been by no means extreme in my body changes," Hardy told The Daily Beast in a separate interview.<h2>How did Tom Hardy bulk up for Bane?</h2>Hardy used a bulk-up "matrix" (check the moves out below) to build muscle on to his chest, arms and shoulders. Using a descending 'ladder' format, Hardy would hit a four-round circuit, going from 10 reps in the first round, to seven, to five, then to three.<h2>Why does Bane sound like an old man?</h2>"And what he did with it was extremely surprising at first. It's an extremely peculiar take on what the voice would be - but once you've heard it for five minutes or so it becomes essential to the character." Hardy said that the voice was supposed to indicate someone prematurely aged from being in constant agony.<h2>Is Bane Ra's al Ghul son?</h2>Bane's Backstory<p>When Bruce is thrown in the same pit Talia grew up in, he learns of Ra's al Ghul's child that escaped the underground prison. It's assumed by both Bruce and audience that the child was Bane. But in the flashback scene, the child who escaped is not wearing a mask.</p><h2>What was wrong with Bane's face?</h2>He was injured early in his story. Hes suffering from pain and he needs gas to survive. He cannot survive the pain without the mask. The pipes from the mask go back along his jawline and feed into the thing at the back where there are two canisters of what ever it is…the anesthetic.<h2>Who is the real villain in Dark Knight Rises?</h2>Bane is a major antagonist in the Dark Knight Trilogy, serving as the main antagonist of the movie The Dark Knight Rises. He is a ruthless terrorist mastermind who plans to destroy Gotham City, as well as the protector-turned-accomplice of Talia Al Ghul. He is portrayed by Tom Hardy.<h2>Did Poison Ivy create Bane?</h2>He is a former serial killer and the strong enforcer for Poison Ivy, serving as her right-hand and bodyguard. Bane was created by Dr. Jason Woodrue and was given his name as intended to be a "bane of humanity".<h2>How did Tom Hardy look so tall in Dark Knight Rises?</h2>A tricky situation, right? But here Christopher Nolan's mind came into the play. In order to make Tom's Bane appear taller, three-inched lifts were used for the actor. Thanks to this technique, The Dark Knight Rises' Bane appeared taller and dominating than other characters.<h2>Why was Bane's voice so weird?</h2>The early word on Bane, as played by Tom Hardy in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Rises, was that the villain didn't speak too clearly. As in, no one could understand what he was saying, and Nolan adjusted the sound mix in order to make Bane more intelligible.<h2>What was Bane's accent?</h2>Hardy revealed how Gorman inspired him. “Taking that into mind, I looked at original Latin … sort of Romany Gypsy. And there was a character, Bartley Gorman … the bare-knuckle fighter, and that's where the accent comes from that I use in the film,” Hardy adds further.<h2>What language does Bane speak?</h2>He knows ten active languages and at least four additional arcane and dead ones. Among these are Spanish, English, French, German, Russian, Mandarin Chinese, Persian, Dari, Urdu, and Latin. The Bane of the Demon storyline reveals that he has an eidetic memory.<h2>Why is Bane so strong?</h2>Venom Usage: He utilizes the super-steroid known as Venom to enhance his own physical attributes to superhuman levels, namely his strength, durability, speed, and endurance.<h2>Who is Poison Ivy's boyfriend?</h2>In June 2015, Poison Ivy was revealed to be romantically involved with Harley Quinn by Harley Quinn series writers Jimmy Palmiotti and Amanda Conner, stating that she is in a romantic relationship with Harley "without the jealousy of monogamy".<h2>Can Superman beat Bane?</h2>2 DESTROY: SUPERMAN<p>There's no denying Superman is a powerful hero, but if Batman can clean his clock on occasion, there's no reason to believe Bane wouldn't be able to either. Of course, it all hinges on Bane being able to secure that all-too-vital element known as kryptonite.</p><h2>What is Bane's serum called?</h2>As an adult, he served as a test subject for the super-steroid called Venom. Superhumanly strong, Bane escaped his hell and headed to Gotham City—where he chose to make his mark by defeating the Batman.<h2>Was Bane the child who escaped?</h2>But, in the climatic scene the movie revealed that the kid wasn't Bane, it was Talia. Furthermore, when Bruce was in the pit, his inmates used to say there was only one person escaped/get out from the pit and that was a small kid. According to the movie it was Talia.<h2>Is Bane the child?</h2>That line alone reveals that Bane wasn't the child from the story, as he didn't see the light outside the Pit until Talia and Ra's al Ghul returned to the prison for revenge as Talia's mother was killed there, and she used this opportunity to save her protector.<h2>Is Penguin in the Dark Knight Trilogy?</h2>The Penguin — The Dark Knight<p>The Joker (the late Heath Ledger) and his goons are in the middle of robbing Gotham National Bank, when they meet the resistance of the bank manager, played by William Fichtner.</p><h2>Is Stan's voice different?</h2>Trey Parker voices a variety of characters on the show. Stan isn't the only South Park character whose voice has been scrutinized recently. Indeed, fans have also noticed a slight change in Mr. Mackey's voice, as well.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8isZJuZnprAbsLOopqeZaSkum60wKubsg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-nikki-haley-catholic-religion-ethnicity-origin.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Nikki Haley Catholic?
