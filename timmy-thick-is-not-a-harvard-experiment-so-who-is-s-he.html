He is a 17-year-old social media celebrity and Instagram sensation, undoubtedly best recognized for running his accounts not only on Instagram but also on Twitter.</p><p>https://twitter.com/timmythick/status/1221877267510501376</p><p>He attracted even more attention, and achieved international fame, after making the statement that ‘Timmy Thick’ was actually a Harvard University experiment.</p><h2><span id=How_rich_is_he_as_of_now_Timmy_Thick_Net_Worth>How rich is he, as of now? Timmy Thick Net Worth</span></h2><p>Timmy Thick’s net worth is reputedly in the region of $30,000 earned through his successful involvement across many of the most popular social media sites. His annual income is supposedly around $15,000, but his activities suggest that both these figures are guesstimates.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_Pseudonym_Real_Name>Early Life, Pseudonym, Real Name</span></h2><p>The social media personality is known only under his pseudonym – Timmy Thick is not his real name, and according to some sources, his real name is Justin – surname undisclosed – or Jason Thick, however, neither have been confirmed, so his real name is anyone’s guess. What is known is that he holds American nationality and belongs to White Caucasian ethnic group – assuming that his online photos are genuine – while other information regarding his parents, siblings, and education remains unknown.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.org///marriedbiography.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DFlexefXYAASk0D.jpg></p><h2><span id=Professional_Career>Professional Career</span></h2><p>Speaking about his career, Timmy Thick became active on the Instagram app in 2016, when he launched his official account under the username ‘timmythebarbie’. He immediately began to post videos of himself twerking, and various other pictures and videos that were provocative and raunchy. His appearance, unusual dress-sense, and eccentric behavior caught the attention of other Instagram users, and the number of his followers increased steadily day by day.</p><p>Even though he had many people who liked and supported him, he also attracted a huge number of negative responders. At one time he had amassed more than 300,000 followers, but soon his account was taken down, since his content negatively&nbsp;affected many people and he was reported to the executives of the application.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8xyDhWnfPk/</p><p>This didn’t discourage him, as Timmy re-opened his account under the username ‘<a rel=nofollow href=#>timmybeenthick’</a>, on which he has attracted over 10,000 followers so far, even though it’s currently set to private. At the same time, he launched his official account on Twitter as well.</p><h2><span id=Timmy_Thick_is_a_Harvard_Experiment>Timmy Thick is a Harvard Experiment?</span></h2><p>In March 2018, a conspiracy theory emerged that Timmy Thick was just a Harvard University social study experiment.</p><p>He posted a tweet on <a rel=nofollow href=#>his official Twitter account</a> in which he stated that ‘Timmy Thick’ was actually <a rel=nofollow href=#>a 24-month-long social study, guided by Harvard University</a>. He also wrote that the study was completed, and thanked his fans for their time. <a rel=nofollow href=#>Jackson Beckfield</a>, who is a professor in the sociology department of Harvard University, denied this suggestion, saying that it was fraudulent or a hoax; Timmy’s account was immediately shut down.</p><p>However, he’s since restored his account, and has garnered almost 40,000 followers as of early 2020.</p><h2><span id=Appearance_and_Vital_Statistics>Appearance and Vital Statistics</span></h2><p>Timmy seemingly has short blonde dyed hair, while his natural hair color is dark brown, and he has dark brown eyes. He stands at a height of 5ft (1.50m), and weighs approximately 105lbs (48kgs). His shoe size is 5 (US).</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life_Is_He_a_Boy_or_a_Girl_Is_He_Gay>Personal Life: Is He a Boy or a Girl? Is He Gay?</span></h2><p>Although Timmy Thick frequently wears wigs, and dresses as a female, he prefers being recognized as a boy; he hasn’t actually commented regarding his sexual orientation, so there is no information as to whether he is straight or not. His good friends are Instagram star Danielle ‘Cash Me Ousside’&nbsp;Bregoli and rapper Ugly God. He is a huge fan of Nicki Minaj, and constantly shares content related to her. Timmy describes himself as a positively-minded person. He is a dog lover.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDm6Con6KWvanFjaipoGeknrquxYytn6Kbm2K2tHnNqKtmmV2drrPCwKubZp2opbKztcyepa1lo6R6uLTOZqCsZaNitaZ7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-taylor-swifts-eye-color.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Taylor Swifts eye color?
