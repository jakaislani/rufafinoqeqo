When interrogated by the police, he confessed to following the young woman because he found her attractive.</p><p class=Zg>The 26-year-old then told the officers that he engaged in a physical altercation with Tibbetts before blacking out and that when he woke up he found her dead in the <a class="zd d" href=#>trunk</a> of his car.</p><p class=Zg>Following these declarations he led the police to the cornfield where he dumped her body, hiding it with cornstalks. However, despite all this, Rivera <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.foxnews.com/us/mollie-tibbetts-cristhian-bahena-rivera-verdict-murder-trial>claimed</a> that he didn't kill Tibbetts.</p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>It was the ending that the Tibbetts family was looking for but not the one Rivera was hoping to find.</strong></h3><p class=Zg>According to him, two masked and armed men burst into his home and forced him to drive them to the location, which was when one of them killed the student.</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>ALLEGEDLY THREATENED</strong></p><p class=Zg>Rivera <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.foxnews.com/us/mollie-tibbetts-cristhian-bahena-rivera-verdict-murder-trial>said</a> that the men threatened to kill his daughter and former girlfriend if he told anyone what had happened, but his side of the story was found implausible.</p><p class=Zg>According to attorney Chad Frese, his client was consistent with that story from the very beginning and that it wasn't in any way fabricated to beat the charges against Rivera.</p><p class=Zg>Brown, however, believes that Rivera's story that he was coerced by two complete strangers didn't hurt the prosecution and even helped it.
