He’d have to defend himself against all of these women. Furthermore, he stated that Ms. Crawford’s claims are verifiably untrue and are intended to deceive. The lawsuit also claimed that Mr. Corn fostered an environment that forced women to work in hostile environments and be excluded. Both women refused to comment on the news.

Both women would be represented by Mr. Williams.</p><h2><span id=Claim_by_Jill_McClain>Claim by Jill McClain</span></h2><p>Jill McClain, on the other hand, is not a party to this complaint but has backed Ms. Crawford’s argument.
