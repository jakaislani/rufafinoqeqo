The three cops raided Taylor’s apartment in southwest Jefferson County while she and boyfriend&nbsp;<strong>Kenneth Walker</strong>&nbsp;were asleep.</p><p>Kenneth thought they were broken into so he fired his gun and shot Mattingly in the leg. In response, Mattingly, Hankison, and Cosgrove blindly fired at least 22 gunshots into the building, some of which entered other apartments, and Taylor, who was shot eight times, died in the hall of the apartment. Hours after raiding Taylor’s apartment, Mattingly underwent surgery to treat the gunshot wound to his leg.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jonathan-mattingly-police-cop-and-lmpd></span><span>Jonathan Mattingly Police, Cop and Lmpd</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He joined the LMPD as a police officer in June 2000. As an LMPD officer, he played significant roles in many drug busts and firearm seizures and received a lot of commendations, letters of appreciation, and award nominations. He worked in the 2nd, 3rd, 7th, and 4th divisions.</p><p>In 2001, he helped a citizen find a lost dog. Later In 2009, he was sworn in as a sergeant. On November 29, 2006, he stopped Tobias Jones, who was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm, and the latter filed a case heard by an appellate court in 2008. The appeal was denied as the court found that Jones’ rights were not violated.</p><p>In 2012, he was promoted to the LMPD’s Violent Incident Prevention, Enforcement, and Response (VIPER) unit, which targeted hot spots of violent crime and the most wanted criminals in Louisville. In 2015, the VIPER unit rebranded as the 9th Mobile Division and he was still part of the new division.</p><p>From the 4th Division, he was promoted to the LMPD’s narcotics division in November 2016. He was commended for his outstanding leadership after helping seize 47 pounds of heroin and 32 pounds of meth in 2017. In April 2017, he used force against a suspect and failed to complete the proper documentation on the same day but the reprimand came with no further sanctions, and received a letter of reprimand for it in 2018.</p><p>On September 22, 2020, he sent a six-paragraph email to more than 1,000 of his fellow LMPD officers, in which he defended his actions on March 13, 2020, when he, Hankison, and Cosgrove raided Taylor’s apartment.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-jonathan-mattingly></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Jonathan Mattingly</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-jonathan-mattingly></span><span>Who is Jonathan Mattingly?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mattingly&nbsp;is an American police officer.
