He was a self-described “bad kid” since he was two years old. His bad behavior prompted his mother to call him “booger,” for which he was teased by his sister.</p><p>When his friends heard his sister calling him “booger,” they started teasing him with this nickname as well. The culmination of McFarland being a “bad kid” happened when he set fire to his family’s trash pile while his mother was away, nearly burning down the house.</p><p>His mother was furious when she found out. Despite McFarland’s bad behavior waning after age 12–13 his nickname stuck, and followed him to LSU, the NFL, and now to his broadcasting career.</p><p>In order to demonstrate his pride in the nickname, McFarland once picked his nose in the ESPN studio and flicked his booger at SportsCenter anchor Randy Scott. Throughout the 2018 NFL season, he would be seen on the “Booger Mobile”.</p><p>It was noted on November 5, 2018, a Dallas Cowboys fan was heard harassing him while in the Booger Mobile. He retaliated by flicking a booger at the man.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=booger-mcfarland-college-career></span><span>Booger McFarland College career</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Booger McFarland played for the LSU Tigers football team from 1995 to 1998. In his freshman year, he started every game at defensive tackle, finishing the season with 73 tackles (including 12 tackles for loss and 2 quarterback sacks) and quickly became a crowd favorite for pulling double-duty at the fullback position for short-yardage plays.</p><p>He also recorded a tackle in LSU’s victory over Michigan State at the 1995 Independence Bowl. For the rest of his collegiate career from his sophomore year onward, he focused on a defensive tackle, and helped bring the Tigers to two further bowl wins in the 1996 Peach Bowl and the 1997 Independence Bowl, also earning 1996 Peach Bowl SEC Defensive MVP honors.</p><p>Despite a spectacular collapse by the Tigers in the 1998 season, McFarland was named defensive co-captain his senior year, earned first-team All-SEC and All-America honors, and played in the 1999 Senior Bowl.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=booger-mcfarland-professional-career></span><span>Booger McFarland Professional career</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Booger McFarland was selected by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with the 15th overall pick in the 1999 NFL Draft.
